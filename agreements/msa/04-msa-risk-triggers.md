## High-Risk Triggers (Mandatory Escalation)

Escalate to Senior Legal approval if any of the following conditions are met:

1. Limitation of liability is **unlimited** or the liability cap exceeds approved organisational thresholds.
2. Indemnity obligations are **uncapped** or expressly excluded from the limitation of liability.
3. New or expanded **carve-outs** are introduced beyond approved playbook positions.
4. Any change to **intellectual property ownership**, or licence scope includes unrestricted sublicensing or commercial exploitation.
5. Governing law or dispute resolution deviates from approved company policy.
6. Total contract value exceeds the pre-approved financial threshold requiring senior management sign-off.

## Automation Override

If any risk trigger is met:
- Automated approval is disabled.
- The agreement is routed for **senior Legal review**, regardless of other intake responses.
